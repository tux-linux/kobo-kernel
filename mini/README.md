This is the Mini-compatible kernel. It includes the following features on top of the existing ones:

- SquashFS 4.0 support
- FUSE support
- NFS server/client support
- kexec support
- Btrfs support

Most users will want to take the "standard" variant, while the "auto-update" variant would be more suited for X11.
Tested and working. Wi-Fi and USB-OTG are yet to come.
